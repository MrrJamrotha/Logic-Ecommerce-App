# If you have a flavor called production you would do this:
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --flavor production

# For a flavor with a name staging you would provide it's name like so:
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --flavor acceptance

# And if you have a local version for devs you could do that:
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --flavor development


More than one 
You also have the ability to specify all the flavors in one command as shown bellow:
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --flavors development,staging,production


All flavors 
And if you have many different flavors available in your project, and wish to generate the splash screen for all of them, you can use this command (starting from 2.4.4):

dart run flutter_native_splash:create --all-flavors
# OR you can use the shorthand option
dart run flutter_native_splash:create -A
